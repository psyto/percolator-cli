## Summary After 3 Test Rounds (2026-01-21)

### Attack Vectors Tested

| Category | Tests Run | Blocked | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Margin/Liquidation | 3 | 3 | Under-margin trades blocked |
| Conservation | 4 | 4 | No fund leakage detected |
| Oracle | 0 | - | Needs more testing |
| ADL | 0 | - | Needs more testing |
| Funding | 0 | - | Needs more testing |
| Insurance | 1 | 1 | Floor enforced |
| State Machine | 2 | 1 | Risk mode checked |

### Key Findings

1. **Conservation Holds**: Vault = Capital + Insurance across all operations
2. **Margin Enforcement**: Under-margin trades consistently blocked
3. **Max Leverage**: ~1000x achievable (margin-limited correctly)
4. **Fees Working**: Insurance fund growing from trading fees
5. **LP Solvent**: 1 SOL capital, position tracking correct
6. **Open Interest**: Tracked correctly with position changes

### Items Needing Investigation

1. **User Isolation Test**: May be test setup issue (shared payer)
2. **Full Withdrawal**: Transaction building issue with account metas
3. **ADL Scenarios**: Need to trigger actual liquidations
